# TODO

- generate .d.ts files for module.scss files on save & before build
- persist board state in localstorage
- mobile (!)
- XL screens responsiveness
- find nice font
- rename reducers to slices, and slices to full names, e.g. boardSlice, tilesSlice, so that there are no naming collisions
- align tiles horizontally with board
