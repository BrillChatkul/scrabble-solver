## History

Back in January 2012 I wrote 200 lines of C++ code to load up a dictionary, store it in a Trie structure, read up to 7 letters from console input and traverse the Trie structure to find all the words that could be created from provided letters. I did it for 200 PLN (about 60 USD back then) and it was my first money earned by programming (assuming that beer is not a currency).

I enjoyed working on it and wanted to enhance that with some visuals to take it to the next level. So I created a simple Windows Forms project in C#, added support for "blank" characters & displayed the results grouped by word length. And I left it like that.

Some time later I got familiar with WPF and somehow I got the idea it would be fun to enhance the C# solver with a visual board input. This would provide solver with information which would allow to find a move that will give you the most points. So in September 2014 I started working on a new C# WPF project, but I haven't got far with it.

After getting experienced with JavaScript, I decided to tackle the challenge once again. I started a new project in February 2017. React on the front, node.js in the back. On September 13th 2017, five and a half years since the beginning, `scrabble-solver@1.0.0` was released. And I saw it was good.

It got to `1.4.0` - I have added en-US & en-GB locales support, a mini tutorial and kept the dependencies up to date (e.g. upgraded React from 15 to 16).

Frontend development has changed, I've learned a few things - it was time for `scrabble-solver@2.0.0`. In 2019 I started to work on a new version. But due to many distractions the work took around 2 years to complete. Nevertheless, here it is, a shiny, state-of-the-art frontend app, January 2021 - 9 years after the first project.
